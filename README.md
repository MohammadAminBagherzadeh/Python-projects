# Python-projects
This repository contains a collection of Python programs developed as part of my self-learning and academic practice in computer science.
The projects demonstrate my understanding of core programming concepts, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking, with a focus on writing correct and readable Python code.

These scripts were written independently to practice logic, control flow, and basic algorithm design.

# Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to:

Demonstrate practical Python skills through small, focused programs
Show my ability to translate problem statements into working code
Reflect my progression in programming fundamentals
Serve as supporting material for academic applications and technical roles
This repository is intentionally kept simple and transparent rather than optimized for production use.

# Technical Skills Demonstrated

Across the projects in this repository, the following concepts are applied:
Python syntax and standard library usage
Conditional logic (if / else)
Loops and iteration
Functions and modular code
User input handling
Basic algorithms (prime numbers, factorials, sequences, conversions)
Simple game logic and randomness

These skills form the foundation for more advanced work in software development, data science, and artificial intelligence.

# Project Structure

Each file is a standalone Python script that focuses on a specific task, such as:
Mathematical computations (factorials, Fibonacci sequence, prime numbers)
Simple command-line utilities (calculators, converters)
Logic-based programs (FizzBuzz, guessing games)
Small interactive programs (Rock-Paper-Scissors)
The scripts are intentionally kept readable and minimal to clearly show the underlying logic.

# How to Run

All programs can be executed using standard Python:

python filename.py

No external libraries are required.

# Notes for Reviewers

These projects represent practice and learning, not final commercial software
Code clarity and correctness were prioritized over advanced optimization
Later repositories contain more advanced topics (e.g., algorithms, AI, and data analysis)
